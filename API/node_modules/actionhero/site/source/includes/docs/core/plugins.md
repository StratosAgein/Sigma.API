# Plugins

As of actionhero version `v8.0.0`, you can create and include plugins for you actionhero project.  Plugins are collections of `tasks`, `actions`, `servers`, and `initializers` that are collected as a module.  You can install plugins via NPM or keep them in a local path.

Plugins are loaded after all local actionhero project files, but initializers follow the same priority scheme as all other initializers.

## Including Plugins

`api.config.general.paths.plugin` (loaded from `/config/api.js`) is an array which contains the search path for your plugins.  This will default to `./node_modules`, but you can add a local path to your project.  Once you have the plugin search paths set up, you use `npm run actionhero link -- --name nameOfPlugin` (or `./node_modules/.bin/actionhero link --name nameOfPlugin`, which is equivalent) to create links in your top-level project to the plugin.  This will also copy over any config files from the plugin into your project so you can modify them.  The act of "linking" simply creates a `myPlugin.link` file in each component of your top-level project (actions, tasks, etc) which tells actionhero to load up files at boot from that plugin.  

You can delete all (or some) links at any time.

## Creating Plugins

```bash
/
| - actions
| - tasks
| - servers
| - initializers
| - scripts
| - config
|
| - package.json
```

To create a plugin, create a project with the following structure:

This structure will allow elements to be loaded into actionhero (we search `/actions` for actions, `/tasks` for tasks, etc)

When developing your plugin locally, you can load it into an existing actionhero project to test it out.

First, add the path your plugin is in to `api.config.general.paths.plugin`.  If your actionhero app is in `/var/ah/actionhero` and your plugin is in `/var/ah/my_plugin`, add `/var/ah` to `api.config.general.paths.plugin`

**Please use the npm naming convention `ah-(name)-plugin` when uploading your plugin to npm**

## Changes in V13.0.0  

The plugin system was significantly changes in Actionhero version `13.0.0`.  Older plugins will not work.  
- `config/plugins.js` has been removed in favor of the linking system
- Config files from within plugins are no longer sourced
- There should be no more postinstall scripts needed, and as such, none are executed
- Be sure that your plugin is OS-independant. Use path.sep for file path separators and things like that. Use relative paths for everything in your plugin.

## Plugin methods

When creating plugins, you may find yourself wanting to do things which could normally be accomplished easily with a "top level" actionhero project, but might be difficult from within the `node_modules` folder.  Here are some helpers:

### Routes:

- `api.routes.registerRoute(method, path, action, apiVersion, matchTrailingPathParts)`
  - Add a route to the system.
